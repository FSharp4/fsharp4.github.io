<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Bonjour/Hi! I'm Jake Peterson, presently a Graduate Student of Electrical
Engineering at the University of Southern California. My focus and passion lies
with VLSI design, both backend (studying CMOS schematic capture + physical
layout using Cadence Virtuoso) and frontend (RTL design, Verilog using Siemens
Questasim).

Prior (engineering) lives:

- I acquired a Bachelor's of Engineering in Electrical Engineering through the
  Honour's program at McGill University (in Montreal, Quebec), where I
  specialized in **Computer Architecture**, **Machine Learning**, and
  **Digital Signal Processing**.
- After McGill, I briefly became an Electrical Design Engineer at Emerson (in
  Shakopee, MN), designing and testing Rosemount Pressure Temperature
  transmitters, and working to develop test automation software in C# and
  Python to work with IVI-VISA and HART communication protocols.

Thank you for visiting my website!
